					<li>(Preprint) Jura, B. (2020) <i>Synaptic clock as a neural substrate of consciousness.</i> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07716">https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07716</a>
					<p class="paper_description">Explained why the definition of 'subjective time' as used in the previous paper makes the synaptic clock well suited to be a potential neural substrate of consciousness.</p></li>
					
					<li>Jura, B., Macrez, N., Meyrand, P., and Bem, T. (2019). <i>Deficit in hippocampal ripples does not preclude spatial memory formation in APP/PS1 mice.</i> Scientific Reports 9, 20129. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56582-w">doi.: 10.1038/s41598-019-56582-w</a>
					<p class="paper_description">We show that APP/PS1 mice, a model of Alzheimer disease, are able to form reference spatial memory when subjected to a 6 days-long learning paradigm in a radial maze, despite a deficit in hippocampal ripples generated during slow-wave sleep. We propose other mechanisms that may contribute to the memory formation in these mice.</p></li>
				
					<li>Jura, B. (2019). <i>A mechanism of synaptic clock underlying subjective time perception.</i> Frontiers in Neuroscience 13, 716. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00716">doi.: 10.3389/fnins.2019.00716</a>
					<p class="paper_description">A hypothesis put forward that synapses can work as clocks which measure time in their own units, determined by the persistence of memory traces of previous inputs, which, due to psychological effects resembling the phenomenon of visual 'flicker fusion', would be the reason why, probably, subjectively perceived time seems to flow with different speeds for us than it does for, say, houseflies, or Keanu Reeves being in the 'bullet time'.<br>(Preprint draft version of the article at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03661">https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03661</a>)</p></li>

					<li>Bem, T., Jura, B., Bontempi, B., and Meyrand, P. (2018). <i>Observational learning of  a spatial discrimination task: learning from the mistakes of others?</i> Animal Behaviour 135, 85-96. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.10.018">doi.: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.10.018</a>
					<p class="paper_description">We show that rats can aquire a spatial information about environment (radial maze) through the observation of another individual performing a specific task in that environment, and that especially beneficial is not observation of errors being commited by the observed individual but rather of information which is new and relevant for the observer, in its particular situation.</p></li>
